/* This is xoroshiro64** 1.0, our 32-bit all-purpose, rock-solid,
   small-state generator. It is extremely fast and it passes all tests we
   are aware of, but its state space is not large enough for any parallel
   application.

   For generating just single-precision (i.e., 32-bit) floating-point
   numbers, xoroshiro64* is even faster.

   The state must be seeded so that it is not everywhere zero. */
