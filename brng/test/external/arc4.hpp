/*
 * This code is derived from section 17.1 of Applied Cryptography,
 * second edition, which describes a stream cipher allegedly
 * compatible with RSA Labs "RC4" cipher (the actual description of
 * which is a trade secret).  The same algorithm is used as a stream
 * cipher called "arcfour" in Tatu Ylonen's ssh package.
 *
 * RC4 is a registered trademark of RSA Laboratories.
 *
 * CODE HISTORY & NOTES:
 *
 * This version is based on arc4random.c included in Apple Libc 549.9.4
 * http://opensource.apple.com/source/Libc/Libc-594.9.4/gen/FreeBSD/arc4random.c
 * At the time of writing, this version of the source is the first one
 * found with a Google search for arc4random.c, even though it is not the
 * most recent iteration.  It was, however, a reasonable starting point for
 * creating a C++ class.
 *
 * Apple's code was a direct import of FreeBSD's 2004/03/24 version of
 * arc4random.c (1.10) (which is available as revision 127373 at
 * https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/lib/libc/gen/arc4random.c), which
 * itself was based the 1997/04/27 version of arc4random.c (1.2) from OpenBSD
 * (http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/lib/libc/crypt/arc4random.c).
 * The FreeBSD version included several small changes made to the OpenBSD
 * source, most notably changes by:
 *      - Christian S.J. Peron <maneo@bsdpro.com> (style, reentrancy)
 *      - Colin Percival <cperciva@freebsd.org> (style)
 *      - Jeff Ito <jeffi@rcn.com> (discard first 1024 bytes, 2004/01/20,
 *        discussed in detail below)
 * (Apple first introduced arc4random in Mac OS X 10.2, released 2002/09/23,
 * which imported FreeBSD's 2000/01/27, revision 1.4 which it kept until
 * OS X 10.5, released 2007/10/26 which is when the above changes, including
 * Ito's change, were first shipped by Apple.)
 *
 * Interesting changes made subseqently to the Apple/FreeBSD code and changes
 * made to other versions:
 *
 * - Amount of output discarded during initialization
 *
 *   On 2008/07/21, Andrey A. Chernov <ache@freebsd.org> reduced the amount
 *   of discarded output to 512 bytes, but then the next day increased it to 768
 *   bytes.  Three days later these changes were backed out, at the request of
 *   Robert Watson  <rwatson@freebsd.org>, restoring the constant to 1024
 *   bytes.
 *
 *   Meanwhile, in the OpenBSD project, Damien Miller <djm@openbsd.org> made
 *   a similar change to Jeff Ito's (in revision 1.10, 2003/11/26, thus
 *   predating Ito's change) but chose to only discard the first 256 bytes of
 *   output. OpenBSD kept using a discard of only 256 bytes until it replaced
 *   Arc4 on 2013/10/01 with ChaCha20 from Nick Mathewson's libottery (an
 *   implementation of Daniel J. Bernstein's Salsa20 stream cipher).  Thus
 *   for over nine years, OpenBSD used a key scheduling scheme that was
 *   considered "too weak" by the FreeBSD developers.
 *
 * - Periodic stirring
 *
 *   In a cryptograpically secure generator, it is wise to periodically
 *   destroy the state of the generator and replace it with an entirely fresh
 *   one.   On 2005/06/04, Ted Unangst <tedu@openbsd.org> added periodic
 *   stirring, causing the generator to reseed itself after producing 40000
 *   outputs.  On 2006/10/04, Andrey A. Chernov <ache@freebsd.org> adopted
 *   this change.  On 2007/02/12, Otto Moerbeek <otto@openbsd.org> changed
 *   the constant to 1600000 without any comment about why (openbsd, r1.15)
 *   and on 2008/07/21 Andrey A. Chernov <ache@freebsd.org> adopted that
 *   change for FreeBSD.
 *
 * - Avoiding *very* short periods
 *
 *   The period of RC4 depends on its initialization.  Some initializations can
 *   cause *very* short periods.  The initial implementation did not correctly
 *   avoid weak initialization, meaning that more than 1 time in 75000, the
 *   period of the generator could be tiny, only 16320 integers
 *   (i.e., 65280 bytes of output).
 *
 *   Theo de Raadt fixed the issue on 1999/09/28 (revision 1.5) but his commit
 *   comment was
 *      "Set j = i after arc4random key schedule to be more like
 *      arc4 stream cipher; from conversations between various people"
 *   which did not give much clue as to the seriousness of the issue, possibly
 *   because he was not aware just how serious it was or because he thought
 *   it unwise to draw attention to the flaw.
 *
 *   The issue it went unnoticed by the FreeBSD developers and was not fixed
 *   until Andrey A. Chernov <ache@freebsd.org> did so on 2008/07/22, almost
 *   nine years later.
 *
 *   Apple did not update its FreeBSD sources until OS X Lion (10.7,
 *   Libc-763.11), which was released on 2011/07/20, almost twelve years
 *   after the flaw was found and fixed by Theo de Raadt.  Presumably the
 *   fix was also applied to iOS 5, which was released that year.
 *
 * This version of the code applies the simple fix for avoiding short periods,
 * and keeps the amount of discarded initial output at 1024 bytes.  It does
 * not provide periodic stirring.  In my opinion, if you want to destroy your
 * RNG state, you should either
 *      - do it manually, after performing a sensitive task, or,
 *      - do it periodically using a timer
 * Also, arbitrary reseeding breaks reproducable behavior, which is required
 * by C++ and by cryptographic uses.
 *
 * This version also changes the initialization setup to use a C++11 seed
 * sequence (or work-alike).  This allows the generator to provide
 * reproducible random numbers.
 *
 * The code is also generalized to allow the number of S-Boxes to be changed.
 * The code can only be used to generate sensible random numbers if the
 * number of boxes is a power of two (controlled by setting the BITS template
 * parameter).
 *
 * Note that setting BITS < 6 creates a generator that does *not* pass
 * TestU01's BigCrush test battery (although BITS == 5 is sufficient to pass
 * SmallCrush).
